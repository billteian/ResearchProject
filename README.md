# ResearchProject
This research explores the connection between music and mental health using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results/data)


Python, along with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, is utilized for data manipulation, analysis, and statistical visualization.

The study is divided into three parts: first, understanding the dataset by examining its structure, columns, and basic characteristics; second, visualizing the data to uncover patterns and trends; and third, investigating key questions, such as how listening to music while working impacts anxiety, whether frequent exposure to high-energy genres like EDM, Hip-Hop, or Metal is linked to changes in stress and anxiety levels, and how age groups, particularly younger versus older individuals, differ in their responses to musicâ€™s influence on mental health. 

This research aims to provide a data-driven understanding of how music can affect emotional and psychological well-being.
